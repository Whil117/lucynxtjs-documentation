# About Lucy Nxtjs

Lucy means in spanish "Luciente" or "Reluciente", But why only Lucy? Well if called the library LUCE or LUCI is english means a fish pike and "luci" means lights u other mean. for that reason I called lucy with the complement Nxtjs that means Next.js
And Lucy is a acronym of "**L**ibrary for Next.js **U**sing Ract **C**omponents Efficientl**y**"

## Inspired

Inspired in other libraries such: [StacklyUI](https://github.com/StacklyCode/StacklyUI), Its a great architecture where you can create strong applications with their atomic components.

## Motivation

When I work with StacklyUI, I like the abstract atoms components, So I learned a lot of concepts of react.js with Next.js So I want to share with other communities programmers my knowledge, Inspired for the architecture StacklyUI with atomic design, The programmers can create a UI interfaces with React.js Quickly and understand the concepts

## Purpose

The purpose of my library is to help new programmers quickly learn how ReactJS works and understand ReactJS concepts
